# I'm Rishabh! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an enthusiastic open-source developer dedicated to crafting tools that simplify and enhance everyday tasks.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I've been working on:

- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/Rishabh5321/dotfiles)**: Streamlined NixOS configuration files designed to optimize development environments.

- **[wallsite](https://github.com/Rishabh5321/wallsite)**: This is a self-hostable wallpaper gallery project. Its primary goal is to be distributed as a user-friendly GitHub template, allowing others to easily create and deploy their own galleries. The project supports two main deployment methods: a simple Git-based deployment via Vercel/Netlify and an advanced self-hosted deployment via Docker.

- **[Docker-Compose_Template](https://github.com/Rishabh5321/Docker-Compose_Template)**: A comprehensive template to facilitate the setup of Docker Compose environments.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: Nix, Docker, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python, Bash, PowerShell
